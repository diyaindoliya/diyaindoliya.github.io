# about me

I am a junior at UCLA (class of 2024) studying Cognitive Science with a specialization in Computing and a minor in Statistics. Currently, I am a UX/UI designer for [Rivet](https://www.rivet.app/), an MIT-based startup dedicated to helping artists connect with their fans. I'm also a designer for [LA Blueprint](https://lablueprint.org/), a student-run organization striving to make technology accessible to underprivileged communities and promote public welfare.


## research interests
- interaction design, including user interfaces and experience design
- user psychology and behavior in relation to technology / digital products
- emerging technologies (such as AI and voice-to-text) and their impact on UX/UI design
- accessibility and inclusive design
- mobile and responsive design
- design trends and their impact on user experience


## other passions
- writing ([read some of the articles I've written for the Daily Bruin here!](https://dailybruin.com/author/diya-indoliya))
- environmentalism & sustainability
- mental health and wellness (particularly in Asian communities)
- music (especially live music)


I currently live in Los Angeles, but I come from Newark, California in the SF Bay Area. My pronouns are she/her. I am an avid lover of Taylor Swift's songwriting (folklore and Red are my favorite albums of all time)!
