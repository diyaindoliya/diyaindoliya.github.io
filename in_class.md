### GEOG 5HC ~ Sustainable Environmental Design in Green Roofs
I researched and designed a green roof that could feasibly be implemented at UCLA!

Check out the full paper I wrote for this project [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19DwKa4WBqSAEJacNKw317isk-yTlM7Dy/view?usp=sharing).

### BearWear Landing Page
I designed a landing page for a hypothetical UCLA apparel shop called BearWear as part of an application!

This ended up being a super fun creative project for me to dive deeper into my own design preferences starting from scratch.
