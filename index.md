I'm an undergrad at UCLA studying Cognitive Science with a specialization in Computing and a minor in Statistics. 

I'm extremely drawn to the intersection of art, psychology, and technology. Currently, I am a UX design lead at <a href="https://rivet.app" target="_blank">Rivet</a> as well as a designer for <a href="https://lablueprint.org/" target="_blank">LA Blueprint</a>'s <a href="https://www.skidrowartsalliance.com/" target="_blank">Skid Row Arts Alliance</a> mobile app.
