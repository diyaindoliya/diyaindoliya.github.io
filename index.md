I'm an undergrad at UCLA studying Cognitive Science with a specialization in Computing. I'm also a statistics minor! 

I am super interested in the intersection of art, psychology, and technology and am currently a UX design intern at [Rivet](https://www.rivet.app/) and a designer for [LA Blueprint](https://lablueprint.org/).
