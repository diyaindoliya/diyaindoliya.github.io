I'm an undergrad at UCLA studying Cognitive Science with a specialization in Computing and a minor in Statistics. 

I'm extremely drawn to the intersection of art, psychology, and technology â€” currently, I am a UX design intern at [Rivet](https://www.rivet.app/) and a designer for [LA Blueprint](https://lablueprint.org/)'s upcoming [Skid Row Arts Alliance](https://www.skidrowartsalliance.com/) mobile app.
